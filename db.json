      "weatherInfo": "Weather at Castle Mountains changes with the seasons. Freezing temperatures are expected in winter, with occasional snow. Spring brings mild warm days and cooler nights. With enough rain, wildflowers can carpet the area, making for spectacular displays. Summer months are much hotter, with temperatures nearing 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Strong monsoonal storms in late summer may cause flash-flooding in low-lying areas and can create hazardous road conditions. Fall is a cooler respite after the heat of summer.",
